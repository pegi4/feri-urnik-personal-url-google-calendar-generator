# How to Use the Calendar URL Generator

## Overview

This tool allows you to generate a customized iCalendar URL based on your personal timetable from the Wise Time Table platform. The generated URL can then be added to Google Calendar or other calendar applications for easy synchronization. You can specify the subjects you're enrolled in and the respective groups for each subject.

## Why?

The Wise Time Table exports the iCalendar files with all subjects by default, making it cumbersome to filter out irrelevant subjects. This service simplifies the process by allowing you to specify which subjects and groups you want to include in the calendar. The result is a clean, personalized calendar that reflects only the events relevant to you.

## Solution

The Calendar URL Generator lets you:

- Input your **Filter ID** (from the Wise Time Table) and select the subjects and groups you are part of.
- Automatically generate a URL that can be added to your Google Calendar for automatic syncing.
- Customize the subjects and group numbers, and receive only the events relevant to your schedule.

Once you have the URL, you can simply copy it and paste it into Google Calendar, Thunderbird, or any other calendar application that supports iCalendar URLs.

## Usage

### 1. Enter Filter ID:
- Navigate to the Wise Time Table website and generate the filterId by selecting your preferred timetable options.
- The Filter ID is part of the permanent link you get from Wise Time Table. For example, in the link:

https://www.wise-tt.com/wtt_um_feri/index.jsp?filterId=0;37;0;0


The `filterId=0;37;0;0` is the value you need to input in the generator.

### 2. Add Subjects and Groups:
- Specify the subjects you want to include in your calendar. For each subject, you can also specify the group number if applicable.
- If a subject doesn't have group-specific sessions (e.g., lectures), you can leave the group field empty or use "null" as a placeholder.

### 3. Generate URL:
- Once you've entered your subjects and groups, the tool will dynamically generate a URL. This URL will point to a filtered version of your timetable, including only the relevant subjects and sessions.

### 4. Copy the URL:
- Use the copy button to easily copy the URL to your clipboard. You can then paste this URL into Google Calendar or any other calendar app that supports iCal subscriptions.

#### Example URL:

https://feri-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?filterId=0;89;0;0;&subjects=PODATKOVNE%20BAZE%20I,2;UVOD%20V%20PLATFORMNO%20ODVISEN%20RAZVOJ%20APLIKACIJ,2;UPORABNI%C5%A0KI%20VMESNIKI,1;OSNOVE%20STATISTIKE,3;DISKRETNA%20MATEMATIKA,null;RA%C4%8CUNALNI%C5%A0KA%20OMRE%C5%BDJA,1

## Google Calendar Integration

To integrate with Google Calendar:

1. Open Google Calendar.
2. On the left-hand side, click the "+" icon next to "Other calendars" and select "From URL."
3. Paste the URL generated by the tool.
4. Click "Add Calendar."

Your calendar will automatically sync with the events filtered based on the subjects and groups youâ€™ve selected.
